# Grocery-App
Config files for my GitHub profile.

It is a an android application which is built using kotlin.

When we go to market to buy something(especially groceries) we just forget what we had to buy. One of the options is to write those items on a paper but that too
could be lost. So the main objective of this app is to keep the list of grocery items in your phone so that you can just access them in one click.
